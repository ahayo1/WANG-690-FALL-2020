**Crime Data:**
The crime.csv file cannot be uploaded to GitHub because it is too large, so you will not find it in the Data Files subfolder.

The file can be found at https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime under 'Resources'. I used the 'Crime - comma-separated values'. The data will be different than the data I original used because the data is continuously updated. I downloaded the file on 11 October 2020 and that is what I used for this project.

**Data Files:**
All of the files in the Data Files subfolder are needed to be in the library, although not all of them are called in the code. They are being called behind the scenes when you are plotting some of the mappings.

**Plotly Graphs:**
None of the plotly graphs will not show up in the Jupyter Notebook. They can all be found in the Graphs subfolder. They are labeled by the section they are in as well as a title.
