# StatsViz - 01 Class Notes: 27 August

Overview of class:
- Made introductions with classmates
- Looked over the survery data
- Explored different options for python environments
- Learned about github

### Python Environments
Created an account on *notebooks.ai* which spins up a free Jupyter environment.
There are three ways to use Python within this environment:
1. Interactive Shell
2. Python Script
3. Jupyter Notebook

REPL
